    "text": "Abraham de Moivre, an century statistician and consultant to gamblers, was often called upon to make these lengthy computations. de Moivre noted that when the number of events (coin flips) increased, the shape of the binomial distribution approached a very smooth curve.de Moivre reasoned that if he could find a mathematical expression for this curve, he would be able to solve problems such as finding the probability of or more heads out of coin flips much more easily. This is exactly what he did, and the curve he discovered is now called the ‚Äúnormal curve.‚Äù\nOne of the first applications of the normal distribution was to the analysis of errors of measurement made in astronomical observations, errors that occurred because of imperfect instruments and imperfect observers. Galileo in the century noted that these errors were symmetric and that small errors occurred more frequently than large errors. This led to several hypothesized distributions of errors, but it was not until the early century that it was discovered that these errors followed a normal distribution. Independently, the mathematicians Adrain in and Gauss in developed the formula for the normal distribution and showed that errors were fit well by this distribution.\nThis same distribution had been discovered by Laplace in when he derived the extremely important central limit theorem, the topic of a later section of this chapter. Laplace showed that even if a distribution is not normally distributed, the means of repeated samples from the distribution would be very nearly normally distributed, and that the larger the sample size, the closer the distribution of means would be to a normal distribution.\nQu√©telet was the first to apply the normal distribution to human characteristics. He noted that characteristics such as height, weight, and strength were normally distributed."
